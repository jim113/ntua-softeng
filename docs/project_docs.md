# Goal



The goal of the project is to create a sustainable and fully working price observatory system in which users can see, compare and update product prices among different shops in Greece.



## Users



The users can be classified in the following three categories:

* Visitors

  Visitors can only track products but not update them or add new.

* Users

  Users can track & update & insert products/prices.

* Admins

  Admins can track & update & insert products/prices & manage users.
